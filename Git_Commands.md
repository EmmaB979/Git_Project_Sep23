# Manual Git Commands

1. `git init`
   
   Initializing a git project folder

2. `git add <file_name>`
   
   Sending file to staging area

3. `git commit -m "meaningful message"`
   
   How to commit to create my first snapshot
   
   Meaningful message: Why, how, limitations, effects
   
   Why writing the message: for future self and collaborators, explain what you did. 
   
   Without the -m, Git will ask/force you to write a message, can have outline with title  (followed by empty line) and multiple lines with description (not after a "#")

4. `git status`
   
   Gives uncommitted changes, staged and unstaged changes and untracked files (completely new files) from all conceptual areas as a report. 
   
   ALWAYS DO BEFORE ADDING AND/OR COMMITTING

5. `git ignore`
